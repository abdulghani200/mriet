<p style="text-align:justify">	Research and Development cell is an integral part of the activities of the college. This cell is one of the wings of the Institute which facilitates, channelizes, records, and regulates all the academic, sponsored, collaborative research projects and consultancy works in the Institute. In a world increasingly propelled by technology, academic research forms the mainspring of a nation’s economic growth. MRIET aspires to transform the lives of young budding engineers through their innovative ideas to contribute for research at academic level. MRIET is closely working with core industries to train the students in this direction. This objective will be very close to the heart of the industry in the direction of producing ready to be employed engineers. The key goal of the Institute is to provide a creative atmosphere in which higher studies and research thrive amongst the faculty and students. It also promotes and manages Institute-Industry interaction.
